# Movie-Info-App

Introducing my latest project, the Movie Info App! As a movie enthusiast, I created this JavaScript application to provide users with comprehensive information on any movie they're interested in. From ratings to cast and crew details, my app has everything you need to know about your favorite films.

Installation: To use the Movie Info App, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. You'll also need to obtain an API key from a movie data provider such as IMDb.

Usage: Using this app is simple. Just enter the title of the movie you're interested in into the search bar and hit the "Search" button. Our app will retrieve all the information on the movie and display it on the screen for you to explore.

Project Structure: The Movie Info App comprises a single HTML file (index.html), a CSS file (style.css), and a JavaScript file (script.js). The HTML file provides the structure for the application, while the CSS file handles the styling of the interface. The JavaScript file is responsible for fetching movie data from the movie data provider API and displaying it on the screen.
